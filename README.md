# UCI SWE240 Assignment 2 Edwin Miyatake 61346496
Task Description: Complete the following tasks. ***Also, write sample test cases to validate your implementation for each task.

Task-1: Implement a stack data structure from scratch. You canâ€™t use built-in Stack APIs. You can use the built-in Array or List or your custom-built LinkedList.  The Stack class must have the following functions. Write sample test cases to validate your implementation.

Task-2: Given a string str that represents an arithmetic expression, evaluate the arithmetic expression.  The arithmetic expression can only include any arithmetic operators (i.e., +, -, /, *) and numeric operands, i.e., any integer from  (-2^31) to (2^31-1).  There may be one or more white spaces between an operand and an operator. You should ignore the white spaces while scanning. For an invalid expression, i.e., any operand other than numeric values, invalid operator, or division by 0, either return NaN or throw an exception. You have to use the stack you implemented in Task-1 of the assignment. Write sample test cases to validate your implementation.

Task-3: Implement a Queue data structure from scratch. You cannot use built-in Queue APIs. You can use the built-in Array or List or your custom-built LinkedList.  The Queue class must have the following functions. Write sample test cases to validate your implementation.

Task-4: Implement a Stack using only two instances of your implemented Queue class (Task-3).  Write sample test cases to validate your implementation.
